## Roll-A-Ball Midterm Project
Roll-A-Ball is a tutorial that Unity has on their website. In this tutorial you make a game where the player controls a ball, and the goal is to pick up spinning cubes to beat the level while avoiding chasing enemies. For the midterm we had to add additional features to the game and create a new level. I added the ability to shoot projectiles and an enemy that would shoot at the player.

## Final Project 
For the final I made a simple 2D platformer in 3D.  You play as a wizard platforming your way through the level casting spells to destroy enemies.  Along the way you can find healing circles to refill your health.
